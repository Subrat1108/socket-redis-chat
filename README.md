# socket-redis-chat
Basic chat application using redis, socket and mongodb

This is an Express app, although it doesn't feature any api calls. The app has basic HTML, bootstrap CSS and Javascript in the frontend.
I have used mongodb as a database and redis for caching.
For a seamless chatting experience, I have used Socket.io

How to run the app:

Pull the repository to a folder in your system
Download NodeJs, Mongodb, redis to your system
make sure you have a data/db directory in place for mongodb
install dependencies => npm install
run redis server locally
run the app : npm start
